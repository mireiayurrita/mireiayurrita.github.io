I'm Mireia, a Human-Computer Interaction Researcher interested in developing methods for supporting the design of AI systems that work and grow alongside humans.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher at Utrecht University** in the [Responsible AI](https://rai-uu.github.io/) team. I am also part of the [Hybrid Intelligence Centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/), where I work on new methodologies for Hybrid Intelligence teams, where humans and AI cooperate to achieve shared goals. More specifically, I am designing metrics and processes to measure and assess collaboration between humans and AI.   

Prior to joining Utrecht University, I was a **PhD candidate at TU Delft** where I worked as part of the [Knowledge and Intelligence Design](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/afdelingen/sustainable-design-engineering/kind) team under the supervision of [Prof. Alessandro Bozzon](https://www.alessandrobozzon.com/) and [Prof Sylvia C Pont](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/pont-sc). I was also a **Marie-Skłodowska Curie** fellow at the [DCODE](https://dcode-network.eu/) European project. My doctoral research was positioned at the intersection of Human-AI interaction and Algorithmic Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency. As part of my PhD, I developed conceptual frameworks and I conducted empirical studies (qualitative and large-scale quantitative) to guide the development of contestable AI systems. 

I hold a MSc in Industrial Engineering and a BSc in Industrial Technology Engineering from the University of Navarra, Spain.
