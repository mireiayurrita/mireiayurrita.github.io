Hi!

Prior to joining Utrecht University, I was a **PhD candidate in Human-Computer Interaction at TU Delft** where I worked as part of the [Knowledge and Intelligence Design](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/afdelingen/sustainable-design-engineering/kind) team under the supervision of [Prof. Alessandro Bozzon](https://www.alessandrobozzon.com/) and [Prof Sylvia C Pont](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/pont-sc). I was also a **Marie-Skłodowska Curie** fellow at the [DCODE](https://dcode-network.eu/) European project. My doctoral researcher was positioned at the intersection of Human-AI interaction and Algorithmic Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency. As part of my PhD, I developed conceptual frameworks and I conducted empirical studies (qualitative and large-scale quantitative) to guide the development of contestable AI systems. 

I hold a MSc in Industrial (mechanical) Engineering and a BSc in Industrial Technology Engineering from the University of Navarra, Spain.
