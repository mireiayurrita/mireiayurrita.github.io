I am a third-year PhD candidate in Human-Computer Interaction at TU Delft where I work as part of the [Knowledge and Intelligence Design](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/afdelingen/sustainable-design-engineering/kind) team. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-AI interaction and Algorithmic Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency. As part of my PhD, I develop conceptual frameworks and I conduct empirical studies (quantitative and qualitative) to guide the development of responsible AI systems. I hold a MSc in Industrial (mechanical) Engineering and a BSc in Industrial Technology Engineering from the University of Navarra, Spain.
